# New Main Matsuri Navigation: How to add

- [ ] 1. Add the files [langbutton.css](css/langbutton.css), newnavigation.css, and newNavigation.js to the website's css/js folders.

- [ ] 2. From copy-paste-this.html, copy the lines 20-22 to the head of the website's html template(s). Change the href/src to where you put the files in step 1.

- [ ] 3. Replace the current header in the website's html template(s) with the lines 31-642. Note that I've directed all href's and src's to point to where their equivalents in the current website point to, so there is no need to change those.

- [ ] 4. Done! The new header should look and behave like the one at aralids.github.io.

- [ ] 5. Feel free to ask me anything or let me know if something is not working as it should. :slightly_smiling_face:
